read_text
=========

A a command line tool for text localisation and identification.

This is a fork of [Menglong Zhu](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~menglong/)'s ROS package [read_text](http://www.ros.org/wiki/read_text). I have made modifications for my own needs.

Usage: `$ read_text [image] [correlation] [dictionary]`
